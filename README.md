# Description

(V1) This is a basic "Tic-Tac Toe game board".  Using css grids and a background image, I've replicated a simple, classic game with the simple functionality. 

(V2) Update: Added a start and end button with start and reset functionality using the React hook, "useState".  I've also updated the css file to compliment any adjustments made...

# How to Run

1) Fork the "Tic-Tac Toe" repository
2) Clone onto your machine using Git
3) Drag and drop "ticTacToe.html" into a new tab
4) Innovate it and teach us what you did and how you did it!!!
